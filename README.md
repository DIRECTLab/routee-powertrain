# RouteE Powertrain

## Setup
Clone (or download) the RouteE Powertrain repository and create a compatible python environment to ensure package compatibility.

`git clone https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/routee-powertrain.git`


routee-powertrain depends on python 3.8. One way to satisfy this is to use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/):
```
conda create -n routee-powertrain python=3.8 
conda activate routee-powertrain
```
This will create a new conda environment that uses python 3.8.

Navigate to the the routee-powertrain root directory. Then: 

```
pip install .
```

You will now be able to import routee-powertrain in your code with:
```
import powertrain
```

## Pre-Trained Models
RouteE-Powertrain comes prepackaged with a few standard models and can access a large library of pretrained models.

To see which models are available you can use the function `list_available_models` and then you can load any model
with the function `load_pretrained_model`. 

Here's a sample workflow:

```python
import powertrain as pt

# determine which models are available
model_names = pt.list_available_models()
for name in model_names:
  print(name)

leaf = pt.load_pretrained_model("2016_Nissan_Leaf_30_kWh_ExplicitBin")
```

## Test Data
If you are developing on the routee-powertrain projects and plan to run any of the tests, you will need to also download the test data from [Box](https://app.box.com/s/dm5w4mo56ej9jfmyo404kz98roz7jat7). 

It is recommended that you move the downloaded and unzipped "routee-powertrain-test-data" directory into ```powertrain/tests/```.

## Getting Started

RouteE has two core functions: model training and energy prediction. The below image highlights RouteE's capabilities:

</p>


The typical user will utilize RouteE's catalog of pre-trained models. Currently, the 
catalog consists of light-duty vehicle models, including conventional gasoline, diesel, plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), 
hybrid electric (HEV), and battery electric (BEV). These models can be applied to link-level driving data (in the form 
of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes) to output energy consumption predictions. Such predictions can be 
applied to single-vehicle routes or network-wide traffic data.

Users that wish to train new RouteE models can do so. The model training function of RouteE enables users to use their 
own drive-cycle data, powertrain modeling system, and road network data to train custom models. 

This [routee-notebooks](https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/routee-notebooks) repo provides demonstrations notebooks for 
examples of RouteE usage. 

## Training Workflow
Training batches of RouteE models from FASTSim results can be performed with the [batch-train script](https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/routee-powertrain/tree/master/scripts/batch-train)
