# Developer Scripts

Scripts used by the developers for various tasks

## build_box_shared_links.py

This script is used to build the links that can be used to download pre-trained models.

There are a couple of pre-requisites for this script to work:

- You need to have an NREL Box account
- You need to set up a developer API key
- You need to upload a set of pretrained models to a folder in your Box account

Once you have done this, you can run the script and supply all the required information.
